Currently, I am a Bachelor’s student at VIT Chennai, majoring in Electronics and Communication. Besides my domain knowledge of EC and IOT systems, I possess a keen interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning, with adeptness in merging technical expertise with advanced analytical data handling capabilities. I enjoy listening to songs, watching movies and playing cricket.
