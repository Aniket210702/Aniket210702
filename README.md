At present, I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree at VIT Chennai, specializing in Electronics and Communication. In addition to my domain expertise in EC and IOT systems, I have a strong enthusiasm for artificial intelligence and machine learning, with proficiency in integrating technical skills with advanced analytical data management. In my leisure time, I like listening to music, watching films, and playing cricket.
